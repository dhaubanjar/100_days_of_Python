# Inspired by Damien Hirst's Iconic Dot Paintings 

Damien Hirst's dot paintings have long been celebrated for their mesmerizing simplicity and bold use of color, with some pieces fetching prices as high as **$40,000** in today's art market! His work explores the harmony of color and structure, 
drawing us in with its repetitive patterns and hypnotic beauty.

Inspired by Hirst’s vision, I decided to create my own digital version of a dot painting—this time with a twist. Instead of paint and canvas, I used **Python programming.**  By extracting same color from the image, generating colorful, randomized dots in a grid pattern, 
I aimed to capture the essence of Hirst's work in a way that brings code and art together. Each dot has its own unique color, much like Hirst's careful, hand-painted pieces, and the result is a vibrant digital tribute to his artistic legacy.
